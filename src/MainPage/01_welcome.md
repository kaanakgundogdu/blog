# Welcome
Hi my name is Kaan Akgündoğdu, I'm a Software Engineer and I love learning new programming langages. I am familiar with Rust, C++,C and Javascript.
I've been developing in Rust for about a year, and I've been planning to write my own blog in Rust for a long time. And here you have a blog page created with mdBook. This is a personal blog and it will contain technical posts as well as manga and game reviews. At least I hope so.

Here are my links if you want to connect or follow:
