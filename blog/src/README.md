# Welcome
Hi my name is Kaan Akgündoğdu, I'm a Software Engineer and I love learning new programming langages. I am familiar with Rust, C++,C and Javascript.
I've been developing in Rust for about a year, and I've been planning to write my own blog in Rust for a long time. And here you have a blog page created with md-book. This is a personal blog page and it will contain technical posts as well as manga and game reviews. At least I hope so. 

As my first blog post, I would like to explain how I created this page.
